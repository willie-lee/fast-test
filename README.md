## Answers for Summary Questions:
1. *What were the most difficult tasks?*
 
I think making a decision/choice to design the UI elements was difficult since I had no detailed requirements and graphic design.

2. *Did you learn anything new while completing this assignment?*
    
Yes, "Think think think... before coding". I did this - designed a UI mockup.

3. *What did you not have time to add?  What work took the up majority of your time?* 

- *What did you not have time to add?*
    - Several filter inputs for movie type and release year. ( currently the app has only Title filter input)
    - Configure env to store api keys, and use some static images (e.g. loading gif) from local storage ( currently I used 3rd party urls directly ).
- *What work took the up majority of your time?*
    - Building UI elements and context implementation with useReducer
4. *How could the application be improved?*
- Add more search criteria - release year and type of movies (additional filter inputs)
- Cache images
- Add unit test, e2e test
